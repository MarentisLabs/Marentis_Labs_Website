    "section": "The Framework",
    "text": "The Framework\nThe strategic risk assessment framework consists of three core components:\n\n1. Assumption Mapping\nBegin by explicitly documenting every assumption underlying the investment thesis. This includes:\n\nMarket conditions and their expected persistence\nCompetitive dynamics and barriers to entry\nOperational capabilities of portfolio companies\nExit environment and timing assumptions\n\n\n\n2. Adversarial Challenge\nEach assumption is then subjected to a structured challenge process:\ndef challenge_assumption(assumption, context):\n    \"\"\"\n    Apply adversarial analysis to an investment assumption\n    \"\"\"\n    scenarios = generate_stress_scenarios(assumption)\n    vulnerabilities = identify_weak_points(assumption, context)\n    \n    return {\n        'stress_scenarios': scenarios,\n        'vulnerabilities': vulnerabilities,\n        'mitigations': propose_mitigations(vulnerabilities)\n    }\n\n\n3. Mitigation Design\nFor each identified vulnerability, develop specific mitigations:\nPortfolio-level hedging strategies\nDue diligence deepening in high-risk areas\nGovernance structures to monitor key indicators\nExit optionality and downside protection"

    "section": "Case Application",
    "text": "Case Application\nConsider a growth equity investment in a SaaS company. Standard analysis focuses on growth metrics and unit economics. Adversarial analysis asks:\nWhat if customer concentration proves more brittle than assumed?\nHow does the model perform if churn accelerates by 50%?\nWhat competitive responses might we be underestimating?\nThis process revealed that three investments in our clientâ€™s pipeline had critical dependencies on sustained low interest rates. When rates rose sharply in 2022, two of these positions underperformed significantly. The third, where we had insisted on downside protection, delivered positive returns despite market volatility."

    "section": "Implementation",
    "text": "Implementation\nIntegrating this framework requires:\nTiming: Begin adversarial analysis before term sheets, not after\nIndependence: Challenge must come from outside the deal team\nDocumentation: Record assumptions and challenges for post-investment review\nIteration: Refresh analysis at key milestones\n\nConclusion\nMarkets reward those who prepare for what others ignore. Strategic risk assessment transforms abstract concerns into concrete decision criteria. The cost of analysis is measured in hours. The cost of unexamined assumptions is measured in portfolio returns.\nMarentis Labs provides independent strategic risk advisory to FTSE 350 companies and private equity firms. to discuss your risk assessment needs."
